# MyPix, a Ruby on Rails app to store your pictures online.

Try it here: [mypx.herokuapp.com](http://mypx.herokuapp.com) (hosted on heroku free dyno, so please be patient the app may be sleeping).

Repository is accessible on on (github.com/yannis/mypix)[http://github.com/yannis/mypix]

## Requirements

- Ruby 2.2.0
- Rails 4.2.0

It uses the following gems:

- [Figaro](https://github.com/laserlemon/figaro) for environment variables management
- [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) for authentication
- [Cancancan](https://github.com/CanCanCommunity/cancancan) for authorization
- [Carrierwave](https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave) for file upload
- [Airbrake](https://yannis.airbrake.io/projects/112721/groups) for exception notification

Moreover, MyPix stores its assets and all the user pictures (Pix!) on amazon S3.

It is optimized for mobile browsing (thanks to [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)) and should be able to upload your pictures directly from your mobile device.

MyPix is supported by tests and the coverage is available [here](), thanks to [SimpleCov](https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov).
